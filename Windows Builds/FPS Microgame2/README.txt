Change List-
Add 2 3D assets: The first 3D asset I added to the microgame was a Cheese at the end of a path which hides an enemy behind it. The other 3D asset I added was a mushroom in the middle of the center room which I gave collision.

Modify 2 sound effects: victory jingle and
The first sound effect I changed was the victory sound that plays upon destroying every enemy. I replaced the default sound effect with Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Victory Jingle by SpringSpring. I also replaced the blaster weaponâ€™s shoot sound effect with a futuristic shotgun sound effect made by Michael Klier.

Modify 1 music element: I added an audio source to the scene which plays Glitchy Battle by 3xBlast as background music.
